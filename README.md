# DataBaseInternshipProject

## Project for Advanced Java

This was an assignment in my high school Advanced Java class in January of 2023. It was a project to teach 
how to use the queries and sorts that SQL has. We had to do research on the various internships provided
in the field that we wish to go into in the future then store it in an SQL database. I chose to do this on
the various internships that are offered in the Aeronautical Engineering field. Most of which were provided 
by the large comapnies of Lockheed Martin or Boeing.

Requirements:
1) 10 unique positions listed
2) Records contain sufficient information
3) Table formatted correctly
4) Talbe output is easy to read
5) 2 implented sorts
6) 2 implemented and outputted queries
